## Applying the Lessons of `std::ranges` to Unicode in the Standard Library
### Zach Laine

----

### Why Unicode?

----

C and C++ are the only major production languages in the world without
first-class support for Unicode in their standard libraries.

Unicode support is essential for anyone that wants to support multiple
languages, some of which they may know nothing about.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Ask any English speaker to try capitalizing modern Greek without help.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

----

### Some Terminology

----

A code point is a Unicode "character".  This may be a letter, number,
ideogram, or a combining mark like an accent.

A code unit is a unit of work, usually in one of the UTF encodings.  For
instance, a `char` might be a UTF-8 code unit, and a `wchar_t` on MSVC may be
a UTF-16 code unit.  Multiple code units encode a code point.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

An extended grapheme cluster ("grapheme") is what the end-user sees as a
single symbol.  This might be a letter, a letter with an accent, a number, an
ideogram, an emoji, etc.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

----

The industry standard for Unicode in C and C++ is, and has been for years, ICU.

----

ICU has no support for generic programming.  It uses fixed types for code
units and strings.

If you have a different string type in your code, including `std::string`, you
must make a copy to use the ICU string APIs.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

----

Lack of generic programming support is directly at odds with the way the C++
standard library works.

----

<!-- See https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/blob/main/icu4c/source/samples/ustring/ustring.cpp#L300 -->

From the ICU samples:

```c++
static const char16_t input[] = /*...*/;
char16_t buffer[32];

UErrorCode errorCode = U_ZERO_ERROR;
int32_t length =
    u_strToLower(buffer, UPRV_LENGTHOF(buffer), input, -1,
                 "en", &errorCode);
if (U_SUCCESS(errorCode)) {
    // Use it.
} else {
    // Report error.
}
```

----

What we might standardize:

```c++
std::string text = "YELLING";

my_string lower;
std::uc::to_lower(text, std::inserter(lower, lower.end()));
assert(lower == my_string("yelling"));
```

This is C++ standard-style generic -- iterator-based and range-friendly.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

----

### Design Considerations

----

A major design goal is to make casual/naive uses of Unicode easy for
non-Unicode-expert C++ users.

----

Iterators are important. We should support generic programming, whether it is
done in terms of pointers, a particular iterator, or an iterator type
specified as a template parameter.

Ranges are also important. We should have range-friendly ways of doing
transcoding. This includes support for sentinels and lazy views.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

----

A null-terminated string should not be treated as a special case. The ubiquity
of such strings means that they should be treated as first-class strings.

```c++
char const * text = "text";
auto utf16 = std::uc::as_utf16(text);

// Not:
// std::uc::as_utf16(
//   std::ranges::subrange{text, std::uc::null_sentinel});
```

----

Transcoding cannot be a black box; sometimes you need to be able to find where
there is a break in the encoding, or to detect whether a sequence has any
broken encodings in it. We should provide utility functions that let users
investigate these states.

----

It is common to want to view the same text as code points and code units at
different times. It is therefore important that Unicode-aware iterators have a
convenient way to access the underlying sequence of code units being
transcoded.

```c++
auto grs = std::uc::as_graphemes("text");

auto grs_first =         grs.begin();
auto grs_last =          grs.end();
auto code_points_first = grs.begin().base();
auto code_points_last =  grs.end().base();
auto code_units_first =  grs.begin().base().base();
auto code_units_last =   grs.end().base().base();
```

----

If there’s a specific algorithm specialization that operates directly on UTF-8
or UTF-16, the top-level algorithm should use that when appropriate. This is
analogous to having multiple implementations of the algorithms in std that
differ based on iterator category.

----

Input may come from UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32 strings (though UTF-32 is
extremely uncommon in practice). There should be a single overload of each
normalization function, so that the user does not need to change code when the
input is changed from UTF-N to UTF-M. The most optimal version of the
algorithm (processing either UTF-8 or UTF-16) will be selected (as mentioned
just previously).


```c++
std::string text = "YELLING";

my_string lower;
std::uc::to_lower(text, std::inserter(lower, lower.end()));
assert(lower == my_string("yelling"));
```
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

----

UTF-8 is very important. We expect that the vast majority of users will keep
their text data in UTF-8 the vast majority of the time. It is compact, it is a
superset of ASCII, and it is in widespread use.

Graphemes are also very important. By having C++ users operate on text using
graphemes as their unit of work (as opposed to code points or code units),
they are less likely to mutate text in such a way that reader-perceived text
appears broken.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

----

### Design

----

### `std::iterator_interface`

This very useful for reducing the amount of implementation and specification
time needed to produce iterators and views built from those iterators.

See P2727 and the Boost.STLInterfces CppCon talk for details.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

----

### `null_sentinel`

```c++
namespace std::uc {
  struct null_sentinel_t {
    constexpr null_sentinel_t base() const { return {}; }

    template<class T>
      requires utf_code_unit<T>
    friend constexpr bool operator==(T* p, null_sentinel_t);
  };

  inline constexpr null_sentinel_t null_sentinel;
}
```

----

### Transcoding

I consider the ability to convert among UTF-8 -16 and -32 to be table stakes
for any Unicode library.  It's not terribly intereseting, but it needs to be
done well, and to be convenient.

You can track the progress of committee paper P2728 to keep up with this work.

----

### Transcoding views

```c++
wchar_t const * utf16_text = /* ... */;

for (auto code_unit: utf16_text | std::uc::as_utf8) {
    // Use code_unit ...
}
```

```c++
for (auto code_point: utf16_text | std::uc::as_utf32) {
    // Use code_point ...
}
```
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

This is an example of a null-terminated string being treated as a range.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

The loops would work the same if `utf16_text` were a `std::wstring`.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

----

Views are easy to use and lazy.  They also compose nicely with the other `std`
views.

However, they do leave substantial performance on the table (2-3x, depending
on whether you use SIMD).  Even so, SG-16 has voted to remove the algorithms
from P2728, leaving only the views, reasoning that most strings will be short
enough that perf is not a first-order concern.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

----

As with most `std` views, all the interesting work is done in the iterators.
Those are also available for direct use.

```c++
uint32_t const utf32[] = { ... };
char const utf8[] = { ... };
int i = 0;
for (auto it = std::uc::utf32_iterator(
              utf8, utf8, std::end(utf8)),
          end = std::uc::utf32_iterator(
              utf8, std::end(utf8), std::end(utf8));
     it != end; ++it) {
    assert(*it == utf32[i++]);
}
```

----

Each transcoding iterator produces the Unicode replacement character when it
encounters an ill-formed sequence of code units.

You can pass any of the proposed transcoding iterators any old garbage, and
they will produce a sequence of code units for the parts of the input that are
well-formed UTF, and replacement characters everywhere else.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

----

Each trancoding iterator contains three iterators (or two iterators and a
sentinel).  The first contained iterator indicates the beginning of the
underlying range being transcoded; the second indicates the current position
within the underlying range; the third (or the sentinel) indicates the end of
the underlying range.

For example, `utf_8_to_32_iterator<char const *>` contains three `char const
*` data members.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

----

This is not about memory safety, but about correctness.

If you are using a UTF-8 to UTF-32 transcoding iterator, and you read a single
code point, the transcoding operation needs to read 1-4 code units from the
underlying range.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

----

All the proposed transcoding iterators are bidirectional.

This becomes useful later, with the Unicode algorithms.

----

What happens when you do this?

```c++
auto r = "some text" |
    std::uc::as_utf32 | std::uc::as_utf16 | std::uc::as_utf8;
```

`r` is morally equivalent to
`std::ranges::subrange{"some text", std::uc::null_sentinel}`.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

----

This is accomplished by doing something I call "unpackaing".  Consider:

```c++
using iter_t =
  utf_32_to_16_iterator<utf_8_to_32_iterator<char const *>>;
```

An unpacked `iter_t` will be a UTF-8 `char const *` iterator.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

----

Unpacking is done by a function called `unpack_iterator_and_sentinel()`.  This
is likely to become a customization point.

----

### The Unicode Algorithms

----

### Normalization

Unicode specifies that `"n~"` (`'~'` is U+0303 COMBINING TILDE) and `"ñ"`
(U+00F1 LATIN SMALL LETTER N WITH TILDE) must be treated exactly the same.

----

One of those strings is two code points, and the other is one.  They obviously
do not compare binary equal.  However, Unicode says that these strings are
equal.

To get all your strings in the same form so that they can be binary-compared,
you must normalize.

You can track the progress of committee paper P2729 to keep up with this work.

----

There are two major forms of normalization: decomposed (e.g. `"n~"`) and
composed (e.g. `"ñ"`).  Decomposed is known as Normalization Form Decomposed
(NFD) and composed is known as Normalization Form Composed (NFC).

There are also "compatibility" variants of each of these, NFKD and NFKC.
Casual users of Unicode can ignore these.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

----

```c++
auto nfc_view =
    "sen\u0303ra" | std::uc::normalized<std::uc::nf::c>;
std::u32string nfc_value = U"señora";
assert(std::ranges::equal(nfc_view, nfc_value));
```

----

Insertion and erasure into a normalized string breaks normalization in the
general case.  Consider:

```c++
std::string s = "senor";  // In NFC.
s.insert(3, '\u0303');    // Suddenly not in NFC.
```

----

The details of doing insert, erase, and replace operations while preserving
normalization are easy to get wrong.  Three functions can fix this problem,
`normalize_erase`, `normalize_insert`, and `normalize_replace`.

----

```c++
uint16_t const nfc_a_cedilla_ring_above[] = {
    0x0041 /*A*/, 0x00b8 /*cedilla*/, 0x030A /*ring above*/
};

std::vector<uint16_t> str(
    std::begin(nfc_a_cedilla_ring_above),
    std::end(nfc_a_cedilla_ring_above));
std::vector<uint16_t> const ins(
    {0x0044 /*D*/, 0x0307 /*dot above*/});
auto const result =
    std::uc::normalize_replace<std::uc::nf::c>(
        str, str.begin(), str.end(), ins.begin(), ins.end());
assert(
    str == std::vector<uint16_t>({0x1e0a /*D+dot above*/}));
```

----

### Transcoding in Views

All the views presented take any UTF as input (8, 16, or 32).  They each
transcode to UTF-32, if needed, before doing their work.

Each view looks at the range being given to it, and if it looks like it could
be some UTF, the code is well-formed.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

----

Windows APIs use `wchar_t` for UTF-16.

ICU uses `char`, `char16_t` and `int` for UTF-8, -16, and -32, respectively.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Users in all non-Windows, non-EBCDIC contexts can usually use whatever
character-type they want for UTF-8 (and mostly use `char`).
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

`char8_t`, `char16_t`, and `char32_t` are intended for use where the user
wants to explicitly claim that the encoding is UTF-8, -16, or -32,
respectively.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

----

In order to maximize interoperability with all those use cases, I'm proposing
that the UTF-N concept is `is_integral_v<T>` and `T` is N bits.

SG-16 hates this, and wants the concept to be `same_as<charN_t>`.

----

With the SG-16 way of doing things, you'd need to add some kind of adaptor
that indicates that the incoming range is actually UTF-N.

```c++
std::u8string u8str = /* ... */;
// No adaptor needed.
auto u8str_code_points = u8str | std::uc::as_utf32;

std::string str(u8str.begin(), u8str.end());
// Adaptor needed.
auto str_code_points =
    str | std::uc::utf8_for_realsies | std::uc::as_utf32;
```

----

### Text Segmentation

Unicode has algorithms for breaking on graphemes, words, lines, and sentences.

You can track the progress of committee paper P2745 to keep up with this work.

----

A grapheme is a sequence of code points that form a user-perceived
"character".  As a programmer working on text, a lot of the time you will want
to deal with graphemes, not code points or code units.  You will usually want
to insert, remove, etc., whole graphemes.

```c++
std::string text = /* ... */;
for (auto grapheme: text | std::uc::as_graphemes) {
    // Use individual grapheme here.  grapheme is a
    // std::uc::grapheme_view, a range of code points.
}
```

----

Word breaking is also available.  If we want to print the second-to-last word
in some text:

```c++
std::string str(
    "The quick brown fox can’t jump 32.3 feet, right?");

// Prints "right".
int count = 0;
for (auto word: str | std::uc::words | std::views::reverse) {
    if (++count == 2)
        std::print(word);
}
```

----

Word breaking is very application-sensitive.  If I look at where words are
broken in my favorite editor versus my favorite shell, the results are very
different.

To accomodate different situations, word breaking can be "tailored".

There are two ways of doing this.

----

First, you can customize which word-properties are associated with specific
code points.  First, the default behavior:

```c++
std::string cps("out-of-the-box");

// Prints "out|-|of|-|the|-|box|".
for (auto range: std::uc::words(cps)) {
    std::cout << range << "|";
}
std::cout << "\n";
```

----

Tailoring that treats `'-'` as a middle-of-word letter:

```c++
auto const custom_word_prop = [](uint32_t cp) {
    if (cp == '-')
        return std::uc::word_property::MidLetter;
    return std::uc::word_prop(cp);
};

// Prints "out-of-the-box|".
for (auto range: cps | std::uc::words(custom_word_prop)) {
    std::cout << range << "|";
}
std::cout << "\n";
```

----

Second, you can provide a predicate that takes a large amount of context, and
returns `true` if there should be a break at that position.  First, the
default behavior:

```c++
std::string cps("snake_case camelCase");

// Prints "snake_case| |camelCase|".
for (auto range: std::uc::words(cps)) {
    std::cout << range << "|";
}
std::cout << "\n";
```

----

```c++
// Break up words into chunks as if they were parts of
// identifiers in a popular programming language.
auto const my_break = [](auto prev_prev, auto prev,
                         auto curr,
                         auto next, auto next_next) {
    if ((prev == '_') != (curr == '_'))
        return true;
    if (0x61 <= prev && prev <= 0x7a &&
        0x41 <= curr && curr <= 0x5a) {
        return true;
    }
    return false;
};
```

----

```c++
// Prints "snake|_|case| |camel|Case|".
for (auto range:
     cps | std::uc::words(std::uc::word_prop, my_break)) {
    std::cout << range << "|";
}
std::cout << "\n";
```

----

You can also break up text based on sentence boundaries.  If we want to print
the third sentence in some text:

```c++
int count = 0;
for (auto sentence: some_text | std::uc::sentences) {
    if (++count == 3)
        std::print(sentence);
}
```

----

There is also support for line breaking.  If we want to print the third line
in some text, where lines are delimited by newlines:

```c++
int count = 0;
for (auto line: some_text | std::uc::lines) {
    if (++count == 3)
        std::print(line);
}
```

----

Sometimes you need to print a line, breaking the line off where there is
either a newline, or at the last word that fits in some available space.
That's supported, too:

```c++
for (auto line: str | std::uc::lines(
         60,
         [](auto first, auto last) -> std::ptrdiff_t {
             return std::uc::estimated_width(first, last);
         })) {
    std::cout << line;
    if (!line.hard_break())
        std::cout << "\n";
}
```

This is a forward range, not a bidirectional range.

----

Case-mapping functions are also provided:

```c++
std::string str = /* ... */;
auto uppercased = str | std::uc::to_upper;
auto lowercased = str | std::uc::to_lower;
auto titlecased = str | std::uc::to_title;

bool const upper = std::uc::is_upper(str);
bool const lower = std::uc::is_lower(str);
bool const title = std::uc::is_title(str);
```

----

To make those views produce UTF-8:

```c++
std::string str = /* ... */;
auto uppercased = str | std::uc::to_upper | std::uc::as_utf8;
auto lowercased = str | std::uc::to_lower | std::uc::as_utf8;
auto titlecased = str | std::uc::to_title | std::uc::as_utf8;
```

----

There is also the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm.

Consider a little bit of Arabic text:

```c++
std::string const RTL_order_arabic =
    "مرحبا ، عالم ثنائي الاتجاه";
```

This is the translation of `"Hello, bidirectional world"` that Google
Translate produces.  It's in proper Arabic right-to-left order as it appears
above.

----

```c++
std::string const mem_order =
    (char const *)
    u8"\"Hello, bidirectional world\"\n"
    u8"\"هاجتالا يئانث ملاع ، ابحرم\"";

/* Prints:
"Hello, bidirectional world"
"مرحبا ، عالم ثنائي الاتجاه"
*/
for (auto range : mem_order |
     std::uc::bidirectional_subranges) {
    std::cout << range;
}
```
